## Add New Site To Homestead
If you using [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead) as your development environment, you should know how to add a new site manually. But I find it a little bit annoying that you have type same commands every time. I started search around and try to find any bash script can do same thing for me in one command, I found [this](https://github.com/raffw7912/homestead-add-site) in Github, someone has created nice bash script can do pretty much everything, but it really out-of-date, so I cloned the repo and update a little bit [here](https://github.com/januszhou/homestead-add-site)

## Catch
You need update configuration at top of bash script.
